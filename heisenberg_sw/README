Monte Calro simulation with cluster algorithm (Swendsen-Wang)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:

Sample source code of Monte Calro simulation with cluster updates.
Swendsen-Wang method is implemented for two-dimensional classical
Heisenberg model on a square lattice.

Files:

  A source file

single.dat, cluster.dat
  Simulation results

Usage:

$ make clean
$ make graph

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The source code contains both single-flip and cluster algorithms.
'make' produces two executables, single and cluster which are
single-flip and cluster updates, respectively.

'make run' gives you two results, single.dat and cluster.dat.
The results files contains temperature, square of
magnetization, and specific heat.

Note that, the default values of thermalization loops (T_LOOP)
and number of average (O_LOOP) are insufficient.
Additionally, adopting the same MC steps for the both single-flip
and cluster algorithms do not make sence, since correlation
times are much different between two methods.
